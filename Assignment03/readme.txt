1. Change the path name in the variable "ROOT_DIR" to your desired path. This is applicable for both tasks. 

2. Change the path name in the variable "DESTINATION_DIR" to your desired path. This is applicable for both tasks.

3. Change the path name in the variable "TEST_IMAGE_PATH" to your desired path. This is applicable for both tasks.

4. For Task-02:
	4.a. The folder structure for unsorted data in task-02 should be defined as follows:
			image classification____|
									|_bike
									|
									|_cars
									|
									|_cats
									|
									|_dogs
									|
									|_flowers
									|
									|_horses
									|
									|_human
									
	4.b. The image files for unsorted data in task-02 should be renamed as their folder name. This is VERY IMPORTANT as sorting and data splitting code will not work otherwise.
	image classification____|
							|_bike__|_bike (1).bmp, bike (2).bmp, bike (3).bmp, bike (4).bmp, ... and so on
							|
							|_cars_|_car (1).bmp, car (2).bmp, car (3).bmp, car (4).bmp, ... and so on
							|
							|_cats_|_cat (1).bmp, cat (2).bmp, cat (3).bmp, cat (4).bmp, ... and so on
							|
							|_dogs_|_dog (1).bmp, dog (2).bmp, dog (3).bmp, dog (4).bmp, ... and so on
							|
							|_flowers_|_flower (1).bmp, flower (2).bmp, flower (3).bmp, flower (4).bmp, ... and so on
							|
							|_horses_|_horse (1).bmp, horse (2).bmp, horse (3).bmp, horse (4).bmp, ... and so on
							|
							|_human_|_human (1).bmp, human (2).bmp, human (3).bmp, human (4).bmp, ... and so on
